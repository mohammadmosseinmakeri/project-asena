# V1 Voice Core — Problem Analysis & Requirements

## 1. Purpose

The V1 Voice Core provides the initial reliable voice input layer of Asena.

Its responsibility is to capture speech from the system microphone, convert the captured audio into text through a replaceable Speech-to-Text (STT) provider, and return a provider-independent result for downstream command processing.

The Voice Core is limited to voice input only. It does not perform desktop automation, visual analysis, memory management, or autonomous task execution.

## 2. Goals

The V1 Voice Core aims to:

- Capture user speech through the system microphone.
- Convert captured speech into text.
- Present the recognized text to the user.
- Handle microphone and speech-recognition failures safely.
- Allow manual retry after recoverable failures.
- Produce provider-independent transcription results.

## 3. Scope

Included in V1:

- Microphone initialization.
- Audio capture.
- Speech-to-Text processing.
- Recognition result handling.
- User-visible transcription output.
- Recoverable error handling.
- Manual retry.

The Speech-to-Text provider must be replaceable without changing higher-level Voice Core behavior.

## 4. Non-Goals

The following features are intentionally excluded from V1:

- Desktop application control.
- Mouse and keyboard automation.
- Window management.
- Vision or OCR.
- Webcam or gesture recognition.
- Long-term memory.
- Teach Mode.
- Multi-step task planning.
- Autonomous decision-making.
- Multimodal reasoning.
- Skill execution.
- Cross-platform desktop abstraction.

## 5. User Flow

### Successful Flow

User
  ↓
Voice Core
  ↓
STT Provider
  ↓
Transcription Result
  ↓
Voice Core
  ↓
User

### Recoverable Failure Flow

User
  ↓
Voice Core
  ↓
Controlled Error
  ↓
User
  ↓
Manual Retry

The Voice Core does not interpret commands or decide which action should be executed.

## 6. Inputs

The Voice Core accepts:

- Audio input from the system microphone.
- A user-initiated request to start a recognition attempt.
- A user-initiated request to retry a failed recognition attempt.

It does not directly accept application-level commands such as "Open Telegram". Command interpretation belongs to a higher-level command or agent layer.

## 7. Outputs

The Voice Core produces:

- A successful transcription result.
- A controlled error result.
- User-visible feedback for successful and failed recognition attempts.

Outputs remain independent of the underlying STT provider.

## 8. Failure Scenarios

### F-1 — Microphone Unavailable

- The application must not crash.
- A controlled microphone error must be returned.
- The user must be able to retry later.

### F-2 — No Usable Speech

- The attempt must end gracefully.
- A controlled input failure must be returned.
- Manual retry must remain available.

### F-3 — Recognition Failure

- The provider error must be converted into a Voice Core error.
- Application stability must be preserved.
- Retry must remain available.

### F-4 — Provider Unavailable

- A controlled provider-unavailable result must be returned.
- Provider-specific details must not leak into higher-level logic.
- Retry must remain available.

### F-5 — Recognition Timeout

- The current attempt must terminate safely.
- A controlled timeout result must be returned.
- A new attempt must be possible.

## 9. Architectural Constraints

### C-1 — Provider Independence

The Voice Core must not depend directly on a specific STT provider.

### C-2 — Separation of Concerns

Audio capture, speech recognition, result handling, and higher-level command processing must remain separate responsibilities.

### C-3 — Provider-Independent Errors

Higher-level components must not need to understand provider-specific exceptions or implementation details.

### C-4 — No Action Execution

The Voice Core must not open applications, control input devices, manipulate files, or execute desktop actions.

### C-5 — Replaceable STT Implementation

The underlying STT implementation must be replaceable without requiring changes to higher-level Voice Core behavior.

### C-6 — Controlled Failure States

Expected runtime failures must be represented as controlled states rather than uncaught exceptions propagating through the application.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1 — Microphone Initialization

Given an available supported microphone, the Voice Core initializes the microphone and begins an audio capture attempt successfully.

### AC-2 — Audio Capture

Given a functioning microphone, the Voice Core captures a valid speech sample.

### AC-3 — Speech Recognition

Given a valid speech sample, the Voice Core produces a transcription result.

### AC-4 — User Feedback

A successful transcription is presented to the user.

### AC-5 — Failure Handling

Microphone, capture, recognition, provider, and timeout failures do not crash the application and produce controlled failure states.

### AC-6 — Manual Retry

After a recoverable failure, the user can begin a new recognition attempt without restarting the application.

### AC-7 — Repeated Operation

The Voice Core remains stable across repeated successful and failed recognition attempts during normal operation.

### AC-8 — Provider Independence

Replacing the underlying STT implementation does not require changes to higher-level Voice Core behavior.

## 11. Definition of Done

V1 Voice Core is complete when:

- AC-1 through AC-8 are satisfied.
- Repeated recognition attempts remain stable during normal operation.
- Recoverable failures do not crash the application.
- The STT implementation is replaceable behind a stable abstraction.
- Required automated and integration tests pass.
- Architecture documentation is complete.
- Linting and type-checking pass.

## 12. Success Definition

V1 succeeds when Asena can reliably perform repeated voice-to-text operations while maintaining clear architectural separation between audio capture, speech recognition, and downstream command processing.
